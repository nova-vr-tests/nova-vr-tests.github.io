* NFL prototype

This folder provides implementation of the first prototype for NFL: [[https://www.novamedia.nyc/business-props?post=19][proposal]] 

As of right now, the application allows for setting up players as obj files. An annotation shows up as you get closer and disappears as you go further from the player.
